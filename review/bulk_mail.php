<h2>Wikimania 2011 Scholarship Decision</h2>

<p>Dear $1,</p>

<p>The Wikimania 2011 Scholarships Program Committee has made its final decision on scholarship recipients. We regret to tell you that you will not receive a scholarship to attend Wikimania 2011 in Haifa, Israel.</p>

<p>The Committee judged over 1100 applications from individuals around the world on the basis of their contributions to the Wikimedia projects, participation as a volunteer in both on and off-line activities, and/or involvement in initiatives related to open source, education, free culture, etc. We wish that we could send every applicant to Wikimania, but we are only able to support to a small percentage of those who applied.</p>

<p>If you can make other arrangements for Wikimania 2011, we strongly encourage you to do so! Conference registration can be found <a href=http://wikimania2011.wikimedia.org/wiki/Registration>here</a>. You still have time to receive early registration discounts, so register early.</p>

<h2>Wikimania 2011 Scholarship Decision</h2>

<p>Dear $1,</p>

<p>The Wikimania 2011 Scholarships Program Committee has made its final decision on scholarship awardees for Wikimania 2011 in Haifa, Israel, August 4 - 7 (Hacking days will take place on August 2 - 3). We would like to inform you that, while your application for the full scholarship has not been approved, your application received a high score and we have put your name on a short waiting list of candidates. Please note that we had over 1100 candidates this year, and only a handful were accepted or selected for the waiting-list.</p>

<p>When we send acceptance letters, scholarship recipients are given conditions to respond and accept. If they decline to accept, or if they do not reply in the designated acceptance time period, we award scholarships to waiting-list candidates. The period for the initial list of candidates to accept ends on April 15, 2011. At that time, we will notify you if you have or have not received an award. It is important to note that this is not a guarantee of award, and that many factors can affect the number of scholarships that can be granted.</p>

<p>That said, there are a subset of partial scholarships that are available.  While initially you indicated that you would not be able to attend Wikimania without a full scholarship, the partial scholarship has been increased to $425.  If you would be interested in attending given this subsidy, please email back by April 1.</p>

<p>We highly value your participation on the Wikimedia projects, and encourage your continued dedication and participation. Thank you for your patience, and your interest in Wikimania.</p>
